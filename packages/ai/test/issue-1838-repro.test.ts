/**
 * Issue #1838 — `kimik2 stops in between requests`.
 *
 * Moonshot's Kimi K2.6 endpoint extends the `thinking` parameter with a `keep`
 * field that controls whether the SERVER preserves `reasoning_content` from
 * historical assistant turns across multi-step tool calls. From Moonshot's
 * official docs (https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/guide/use-kimi-k2-thinking-model):
 *
 *   > `null` (default) or omitted: The server ignores reasoning_content from
 *   >   historical turns.
 *   > `"all"`: Preserves reasoning_content from historical turns and provides
 *   >   it to the model as part of the context, enabling Preserved Thinking.
 *   >   Recommended to use together with `type: "enabled"`.
 *
 * And in the K2.6 multi-step-tool-call best-practices section:
 *
 *   > kimi-k2.6 (with thinking enabled) is designed to perform deep reasoning
 *   > across multiple tool calls … To get reliable results, always …  include
 *   > the entire reasoning content from the context.
 *
 * Without `keep: "all"` the Moonshot backend silently drops every prior turn's
 * `reasoning_content` even though omp already sends it on the wire (the Kimi
 * compat path sets `requiresReasoningContentForToolCalls`). K2.6 then has to
 * re-derive its full chain-of-thought from the user prompt on every iteration
 * of an agent loop, which the reporter sees as the agent "stops in between
 * one its requests and does not proceed" while the next reasoning phase
 * silently churns server-side.
 *
 * The fix sends `thinking: { type: "enabled", keep: "all" }` to native
 * Moonshot / Kimi-code K2.6 endpoints. The field is K2.6-only — K2.5 and
 * earlier 400 on unknown fields — and Moonshot-host-only — every gateway
 * (OpenRouter, OpenCode, Kilo, Fireworks, …) translates thinking into its
 * own native format and would reject the extra key.
